Course Requirements
-------------------

### Attendance and Participation

Regular attendance, completion of readings, and participation in discussions is required. This constitutes a significant component of students' performances in the subject.

### Assignments

Students are expected to complete three papers of 4 to 5 pages based on the readings assigned for a specific week. Students will be divided into three groups. Additional details can be found in the [assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments) section.

### Oral Presentations

On the first session of the week in which students have papers due they each present to the class a brief summary of their papers. During the final weeks of the term, when students are no longer obliged to write papers on the assigned readings, these presentations will continue. That is, students in group 1 should be prepared to speak about the readings in first session of Week# 12; group 2 in first session of Week# 13, and group 3 in first session of Week# 14. In some cases the format for those classes might be changed, however.

### Final Paper

Preparation of a final paper, roughly 10 pages in length, on a notable historical work that was not assigned as required reading. Additional details are available in the [assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments) section.

There will be no final examination.
